        <h2>Sophomore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a sophomore at Bob Jones University studying Sports Managment. 
             I work with the <a href="http://www.bjubruins.com/index.aspx?path=mbball">Men's Bruins Basketball Team.</a>
         </p>
         <p>
            I have been athletic director for my society and still enjoy playing sports
             with them. As a freshman I had the privialge to coach our society basketball
             team and leading them to a second place finish. Currently I love travelling
             with the Bruins and spending time with my long time girlfriend of four years.

             I enjoy reading, hiking, and spending time with family.
